# ConcurrentChat

//The Idea
I was challenged to build a Concurrent Chat Server, focusing on efficient message broadcasting and simultaneous client handling. The goal was to create a lightweight, server-based chat system that could support multiple users without performance bottlenecks.

//Development

To ensure a structured development process, as the first step implemented a basic server-client architecture, allowing a single user to connect and exchange messages. Once the core functionality was stable, proceeded to integrate multi-threading, enabling multiple clients to communicate concurrently.

Throughout the development process, I've encountered challenges like synchronisation issues and handling client disconnections, which I tackled by refining our threading model and improving exception handling.

//Final Thoughts

I'll provide my final thoughts once the project is finalised.

//Tech & Methodologies

Java 8 – Networking, Multi-threading, OOP
Sockets & ServerSocket – Client-server communication
Threads – Handling multiple client connections
I/O Streams – Message transmission
Git – Version control and collaboration
